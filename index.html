<p>Product monitoring/recommendation desktop application that informs a user if a particular product is good for them based on their previous product usage history and the reviews on their previous products.
Recommendation based on comparing product ingredients and how similar the product is based on previous products used.</p>

      <h1>How Does SkinSort Work?</h1>
      <p>It works by calculating averages of all the ingredients in the products added to the system.</p>
      <p>It uses the averages to determine the success of a product and ultimately gives a recommendation of the product
        based on how on the calculation.<p>
      <p>The rating of the products are based from 0.1 to 10.0. Any product with a calculated rating less than a 3.3 is considered to be a bad product. Any product between a 3.4 and 6.7 rating is considered to be neutral, neither good or bad. Products above a 6.7 are considered to be good products.<p>
